## CF Pages Functions 405 Investigation
- New CF API token received (D1 + Workers + KV + Pages permissions)
- Stored in Keychain, verified active
- Created D1 database `torr-orders` (ID: `6f241383-60fb-45d9-a75b-b0d4ead7ee2a`)
- Deployed schema: users, addresses, orders, order_items, order_events, sessions
- Rewrote `order.js` and `status.js` for D1, created `auth.js`, `me/`, `admin/`
- Bound D1 to Pages project
- **ALL API endpoints now return 405** — even old code, even without D1 binding
- Removed new files (auth, me, admin), removed wrangler.toml — still 405
- GET /api/order returns 200 (HTML fallthrough) but POST returns 405
- `node -e "require('./functions/api/order.js')"` shows exports correctly: `onRequestOptions`, `onRequestPost`
- **Root cause unclear** — may be CF Pages Functions compilation issue. Needs `wrangler pages functions tail` to debug.
