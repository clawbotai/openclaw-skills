## skill-scout Build Complete
- All 4 scripts built and tested: common.py (311 LOC), discover.py (653), evaluate.py (1233), scout.py (719)
- 29 unit tests passing (stdlib unittest only, zero dependencies)
- Validation: 0 errors, 0 warnings; Doc score: 92/100 EXCELLENT
- Committed as `a754e37` and pushed to GitHub

## Ecosystem Intelligence Gathered
- Ran skill-scout sweep against live ClawHub + GitHub
- Top by installs: sonoscli (235), gog (209), summarize (204), weather (160), github (157)
- Top by stars: self-improving-agent (137), proactive-agent (58), gog (54), caldav-calendar (48)
- Top GitHub devs: VoltAgent (13.8K★), kepano (9.6K★), MemTensor (5.2K★)
- Acquisition candidates identified: gog, caldav-calendar, bird, obsidian, notion, auto-updater, capability-evolver

## auto-updater Security Eval (In Progress)
- Installed to /tmp/scout-eval/ for analysis
- Markdown-only skill (no executable code), instructs agent to run system commands
- Concerns: cron setup, sudo suggestion, npm global updates, bash script creation
- evaluate.py score returned 0/F — skill not in local DB (no source_url); needs manual review

## Key Technical Discoveries
- `clawhub --format=json` doesn't exist; real output is text `<slug> v<version>  <name>  (<score>)`
- `clawhub inspect --json` works but is slow/hangs; `clawhub explore --json` works well
- Two-phase skill development (design prompt → build prompt) produces better results
- Circuit breaker pattern: 3 failures → cached fallback, self-heals on success

## Pending
- User to decide which skills to acquire
- iCloud email still broken (needs password regeneration)
- BOOTSTRAP.md still exists — identity setup not done
- Need to wire guardrails + memory into AGENTS.md/HEARTBEAT.md
- Apply reflection learnings to AGENTS.md and SOUL.md
