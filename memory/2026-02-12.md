## Skill Lifecycle Integration

- User asked to verify all skill errors flow through skill-lifecycle monitor → discovered **zero integration exists**
- No other skills import or use `SkillMonitor` — the monitor was fully built but completely standalone
- `memory/skill-errors.json` never existed (monitor never ran)
- `monitor.py` had Python 3.9 syntax errors (nested triple-quotes in docstrings) — fixed

### Built: Monitored Skill Runner
- Created `skills/skill-lifecycle/scripts/run_monitored.py` — wraps any shell command through SkillMonitor
- Created `bin/skillrun` convenience wrapper
- Usage: `bin/skillrun <skill-name> [--timeout N] -- <command...>`
- Exit 98 = quarantined, errors auto-logged, repair tickets generated at 3+ occurrences
- Updated TOOLS.md with the convention
- Committed: `398bebc`

### Key Decision
- Went with **Pattern B** (agent-level wrapping) over Pattern A (editing every skill) — more practical since most skills are invoked via shell commands
- This is a **behavioral change** — I need to remember to use `skillrun` when invoking skills

## Email
- iCloud IMAP auth failing — app-specific password in keychain (`icloud-email`) may be expired/revoked
- Needs user to regenerate at appleid.apple.com
