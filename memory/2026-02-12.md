## CF Pages Functions 405 Investigation
- New CF API token received (D1 + Workers + KV + Pages permissions)
- Stored in Keychain, verified active
- Created D1 database `torr-orders` (ID: `6f241383-60fb-45d9-a75b-b0d4ead7ee2a`)
- Deployed schema: users, addresses, orders, order_items, order_events, sessions
- Rewrote `order.js` and `status.js` for D1, created `auth.js`, `me/`, `admin/`
- Bound D1 to Pages project
- **ALL API endpoints now return 405** — even old code, even without D1 binding
- Removed new files (auth, me, admin), removed wrangler.toml — still 405
- GET /api/order returns 200 (HTML fallthrough) but POST returns 405
- `node -e "require('./functions/api/order.js')"` shows exports correctly: `onRequestOptions`, `onRequestPost`
- **Root cause unclear** — may be CF Pages Functions compilation issue. Needs `wrangler pages functions tail` to debug.

## MPMP Built (5,151 LOC)
- Full HIPAA-compliant medical practice management platform
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL + Redis (2,701 LOC Python, 46 files)
  - AES-256-GCM PHI encryption, JWT RBAC (4 roles), immutable audit trail
  - Magistral dosage calculator (8 peptide presets, pure math)
  - FHIR MedicationRequest builder, SMART on FHIR OAuth2
  - Azoth OS dual-mode routing (connected vs standalone)
  - 40 unit tests (calculator, encryption, FHIR payloads)
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Zustand (2,450 LOC, 28 files)
  - 10 pages: auth, dashboard, patients, patient detail, calculator, appointments, notes, billing, portal, admin
  - WebSocket real-time inventory updates, role-aware navigation
- Published: github.com/clawbotai/mpmp (private)

## TØrr Statics v3.5
- Re-extracted product drawings from 600dpi source PDFs
- Removed all designer/engineer info (drawing numbers T010-03-xx, Chinese text)
- Added PHILOSOPHY section ("We do not innovate. We eliminate.")
- Added LABORATORY DISPATCH newsletter CTA
- Deployed to torrstatics.com

## 11 Knowledge-Work Skills Architected
- Received 70K-char spec document via email (docx attachment from Steven)
- Source: Anthropic knowledge-work-plugins (Apache-2.0)
- Created SKILL.md for all 11: legal, sales, customer-support, product-management, marketing, finance, data-analysis, enterprise-search, bio-research, productivity, skill-management
- 47 commands, 43 auto-firing skills total
- Commit `a0fd83f`

## Skill Consolidation (27 → 25)
- Evaluated all skills for overlap against new Anthropic-derived ones
- **Merged skill-management → skill-creator-extended** (added composition patterns: sequential/parallel/conditional/hierarchical + validation checklist)
- **Merged productivity → task-planner** (added workplace memory two-tier system + daily planning commands: plan-day, weekly-review, delegate)
- Commit `e7fc769`

## 9 Cross-Skill Integration Pipelines
- Full architecture doc: `docs/SKILL-INTEGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Pipelines:
  1. enterprise-search → email-manager (email as searchable source)
  2. data-analysis → finance (SQL extraction → variance narrative)
  3. customer-support → task-planner (escalation → tracked task)
  4. legal + sales + finance (parallel deal review → merged brief)
  5. PM → marketing → sales → support (product launch pipeline)
  6. agent-memory → all skills (shared brain, P0 priority)
  7. support → search → email (cascading research chain)
  8. security → devops → observability (incident pipeline)
  9. bio-research → data-analysis (genomics → statistics)
- Message bus convention: JSON schema `{ skill, action, payload, context, trace_id }`
- No hard deps — LLM is the integration layer
- Commit `f1989d4`

## Full Documentation Refresh
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite — old version referenced 40+ deleted skills. Now lists all 25 current skills in 4 categories.
- **TOOLS.md**: Updated with all credentials, repos, deploy commands, known issues
- **USER.md**: Updated with 3 current projects, preferences
- **HEARTBEAT.md**: Simplified with active blockers
- Commit `c15f3bd`

## GitHub Repo Descriptions Updated
- **openclaw-skills**: "25 skills for OpenClaw AI agents — infrastructure, engineering, knowledge work, and domain expertise. Cross-skill integration architecture." + topics: openclaw, ai-agent, skills, automation
- **torr-statics**: "TØrr Statics — Precision laboratory hardware. Corporate site + webstore with crypto payments. Deployed to torrstatics.com."
- **mpmp**: "MPMP — HIPAA-compliant medical practice management platform. FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Next.js. Azoth OS integration."

## Current State
- **25 skills** in workspace (8 infrastructure, 5 engineering, 3 knowledge work, 9 domain expertise)
- **3 GitHub repos**: openclaw-skills (public), torr-statics (private), mpmp (private)
- **Active blockers**: CF Pages Functions 405, Hetzner verification pending
- **Next priorities**: Debug CF 405, provision D1 OMS, test payment flow, wire agent-memory into skills
