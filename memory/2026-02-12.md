## Skill Lifecycle Integration

- User asked to verify all skill errors flow through skill-lifecycle monitor → discovered **zero integration exists**
- No other skills import or use `SkillMonitor` — the monitor was fully built but completely standalone
- `memory/skill-errors.json` never existed (monitor never ran)
- `monitor.py` had Python 3.9 syntax errors (nested triple-quotes in docstrings) — fixed

### Built: Monitored Skill Runner
- Created `skills/skill-lifecycle/scripts/run_monitored.py` — wraps any shell command through SkillMonitor
- Created `bin/skillrun` convenience wrapper
- Usage: `bin/skillrun <skill-name> [--timeout N] -- <command...>`
- Exit 98 = quarantined, errors auto-logged, repair tickets generated at 3+ occurrences
- Updated TOOLS.md with the convention
- Committed: `398bebc`

### Key Decision
- Went with **Pattern B** (agent-level wrapping) over Pattern A (editing every skill) — more practical since most skills are invoked via shell commands
- This is a **behavioral change** — I need to remember to use `skillrun` when invoking skills

## Skill Scout Evolution (Evo Loop)

- Full evolutionary loop applied to skill-scout
- Phase 1: Code review of all 3,300 LOC, identified 7 real issues
- Phase 2: 5 tasks completed, tests grew from 29→45
- Key changes:
  - Quarantine workflow: skills download to `_quarantine/` before evaluation
  - 16 new tests for markdown scanner + AST evasion
  - Batch DB writes in awesome list parser
  - Error boundary in threaded sweep workers
  - Compatibility checker false-positive fixes (self-referential regex, local imports)
- Committed: `b4901aa`

### Geni Evaluation
- User asked to evaluate Geni's analysis of skill-scout
- Geni fabricated: ClawHavoc campaign, Koi Security, 341 malicious skills, VirusTotal partnership
- Geni was wrong about: Python 3.9 stdlib (already hardcoded), SQLite locking (already has _write_lock)
- Geni was right about: SKILL.md not scanned (genuine gap), AST evasion possible
- Lesson: **always read actual code before trusting another AI's architectural review**

## Email
- iCloud IMAP auth failing — app-specific password in keychain (`icloud-email`) may be expired/revoked
- Needs user to regenerate at appleid.apple.com

## Agent-Memory Evo Loop
- Applied evolutionary loop — code was well-built, needed config/integration not rewrite
- **Critical fix**: DB path resolved to `skills/memory/` instead of `memory/` (walked 2 levels up from scripts/ instead of 3)
- Cleared test data (Alice/Bob/GraphQL fake memories)
- Made numpy import lazy (stats/help no longer load model)
- Created requirements.txt (sentence-transformers, numpy)
- Imported 26 memory chunks from 3 daily note files into vector store
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with memory maintenance + daily import tasks
- Vector search verified working — query "skill lifecycle monitor" returns correct top result (0.57 cosine sim)
- DB at `memory/agent_memory.db` (124KB, 26 episodic memories)

## Skill Cleanup — Major Audit
- Evaluated all 27 skills systematically by code presence, LOC, relevance
- **Removed 12 skills total:**
  - construction-management, business-development (earlier in session)
  - api-design, data-engineering, growth-strategy, payments, performance-engineering, qa-engineering, hipaa-compliance, mobile-architect (31 lines!), structure-standard, ml-engineering
  - hyperliquid-trading
- All were prompt-only reference skills with zero code, niche/overlapping with base knowledge
- Also removed false `skills/memory/` directory (created by agent-memory DB path bug)
- **Down to 14 skills** — all with real code or genuine utility
- Remaining: agent-guardrails, agent-memory, agent-orchestration, devops, docs-engine, email-manager, observability, product-management, python-backend, security, skill-lifecycle, skill-scout, task-planner, web-builder

## Product-Management Skill Review
- User asked for full details — 768 Python LOC, 2 tools (RICE prioritizer + interview analyzer)
- ClawHub install, not custom-built
- RICE calculator is solid stdlib-only tool
- Interview analyzer is basic keyword NLP — functional but crude
- Asked user if they do PM work to decide keep/cut — no answer yet
