## Hetzner Account Rejected
- Received email from Hetzner (accountverification@hetzner.com) rejecting account K0280983126 after their manual review
- They deactivated the account and cancelled all products/orders due to concerns with the supplied information
- Hetzner email hosting is dead — need alternative provider

## Email Hosting — Pivot from Hetzner
- MX/SPF/DMARC DNS records already exist in Cloudflare for torrstatics.com and samvasquez.co pointing to mail.your-server.de (Hetzner) — **these need updating** when new provider chosen
- Recommended Option B to Steven: Cloudflare Email Routing (inbound) + Brevo free SMTP (outbound) + Gmail "Send as"
- Also offered: Google Workspace ($7/mo), Zoho Mail (free tier)
- Awaiting Steven's choice of provider

## Pension Calculator — Math Fixes & i18n
- Fixed IBL divisor: now FIXED at 120 (Colpensiones standard), was dynamic → inflated IBL
- Goal Seeker: now shows extra/missing weeks over 1,300 minimum, accounts for existing history in 120-month window
- Added English/Español toggle (i18n.js with full translation dictionary, persists in localStorage)
- Deployed to pension-calculator-c55.pages.dev
- Reference screenshot from Steven (email UID 32 "math"): Goal Seeker for ~1,042 weeks person targeting $10M COP
- Verified week arithmetic: 1042+48-1300=-210 (1yr), 1042+240-1300=-18 (5yr), 1042+480-1300=222 (10yr) ✓
- Key reference code insight: solve_pension_gap.py hardcodes `r = 80.0` rate AND `base_weeks = 1823` — this was Piedad's boosted case, not generic
- Project PAUSED per Steven's request

## Salesforce Azoth Org Export
- Connected to Manuel Velez's Agentforce dev org via browser session cookie (SOAP disabled)
- Org URL: orgfarm-b28044d04d-dev-ed.develop.lightning.force.com
- **Full export to `salesforce-export/` (4.7 MB):**
  - 5 custom objects: Doctor__c, Gold_Standard_Case__c, Inventory__c, Peer_Review__c, Wellness_Assessment__c
  - 592 data records across 10 objects (including Account, Contact, Product2, Order, OrderItem)
  - 57 Apex classes (key: PeptideSafetyService, InventoryManager, StripeService, DoctorPortalController)
  - 8 triggers (Account, OrderItem, Doctor__c, Inventory__c, Order, plus 3 Stripe sync)
  - 15 active flows (governance, prescriptions, intake, appointments, validation)
  - 35 LWC components (117 files — doctor/patient dashboards, intake forms, voting interface)
  - 3 validation rules, 38 permission sets
- This is the Azoth peptide/wellness platform built on Salesforce
- **Deep audit completed** — final export is 12 MB, 358 files:
  - Added: 6 Aura components (18 files), 24 VF pages, 4 VF components, 1 static resource
  - Added: 68 obsolete flow versions (full history)
  - Added: Standard object schemas with custom fields (Account 12, Contact 2, Order 4, OrderItem 27, Product2 14)
  - Added: COMPLETE_DATA_MODEL.json (all relationships, picklists, formulas)
  - Added: ARCHITECTURE.md (full ERD, validation rules, integrations summary)
  - Added: Page layouts, record types, scheduled jobs, named credentials
  - Key relationships: Account→Doctor__c, Order→Doctor__c, Peer_Review→Order+Doctor, Inventory→Product2, Gold_Standard_Case→Product2, Wellness_Assessment→Account
  - Safety validation rules: sealed peer reviews, hard deck safety stop, consensus verdict dose limits
  - Stripe integration via StripeConnect named credential
  - 2 Experience Cloud sites (Azoth Portal, Azoth Portal V4)
  - Only gaps: Experience Cloud visual page builder themes, profile XML field-level security, sharing rules
- **Credentials used:** user nadmin.89ca98be6d46@agentforce.com, password Star1234, security token nJXXjSSHxOJBcXCKiOJF7Hxe5
- **Auth method:** Browser cookie sid= as Bearer token (SOAP API disabled on orgfarm dev orgs)
- **Contact:** Manuel Velez (manuelvelez3223@gmail.com) — owns the org
- **Steven's intent:** Extract everything needed to recreate Azoth as standalone software

## Reflect — Lesson Learned
- Lost the Salesforce task across 3 compactions because I never wrote it to memory
- Encoded new rule: log active tasks to memory files immediately, before starting work

## OpenClaw Dashboard GUI Improvements (Requested)
- Steven wants to improve the webchat/control-ui dashboard
- Location: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/dist/control-ui/index.html`
- **Requests:**
  1. More aesthetic design (Steven likes dark-mode, minimalist, industrial — see TØrr design language)
  2. Thinking/processing indicator — show when the agent is working
  3. Progress tracking — some way to show how far along on current request
- Need to inspect the current HTML/CSS/JS first to understand what we're working with

## Dashboard Redesign — COMPLETE
- Discovered `gateway.controlUi.root` config option — copies control-ui to `~/.openclaw/control-ui/` to survive npm updates
- Created `custom.css`: TØrr industrial theme (IBM Plex Mono + Asap, void black #1a1a1c, signal white accent, 3-6px radius, scan-line texture, mono uppercase nav)
- Created `custom.js`: thinking indicator with sweep bar + floating badge with elapsed timer via MutationObserver
- Patched `index.html` to load both custom files
- Set `gateway.controlUi.root` → `~/.openclaw/control-ui/`, gateway restarted

## QNAP NAS — Kids Library & Media Management
- **Kids Plex libraries created**: "Kids Movies" (section 5, 59 symlinked movies), "Kids TV Shows" (section 6, 22 symlinked shows)
- Paths: `/share/ZFS2_DATA/Public/Library/kids/movies/` and `kids/tv/`
- Symlink quirk: QNAP busybox `ln -sf` to directory targets creates empty dirs — must `rm` first then `ln -s`
- **Radarr optimized**: auto-rename, quality upgrades (Bluray-1080p cutoff), TRaSH-style custom formats (Remux +2000, DV +2000, HDR10+ +1500, Atmos +1500, HEVC +1000, Multi-Audio +500), import extras, hardlinks
- **Disney catalog added**: ~65 Disney/Pixar movies to Radarr, 19 animated Disney shows to Sonarr
- Triggered WEB replacement search for all movies and shows (deleted existing files first to force re-grab)
- **Radarr has no indexers** — Prowlarr container exists but not yet connected
- Steven wants animated-only Disney/Pixar shows (not live-action)

## Kids Auto-Download Setup — IN PROGRESS
- Goal: movies/shows tagged as kid-friendly auto-download to kids Plex folders
- Plan: Add `/kids-movies` and `/kids-tv` as second root folders in Radarr/Sonarr
- **Blocker**: Radarr/Sonarr Docker containers don't have `/kids-movies` or `/kids-tv` volume mounts
- Container Station API (v1) works for listing containers but inspect/modify endpoints return 404 on QuTS Hero h6.0.0 Beta
- QTS CGI API also returns error pages — h6.0.0 Beta has different API structure
- Successfully authenticated to both Container Station (CS_SESS_ID cookie) and QTS (QTS_SSID cookie, base64-encoded password)
- **Need SSH enabled** to use docker CLI for container recreation, OR do it via Container Station web UI
- Asked Steven to enable SSH via QTS Control Panel → Network & File Services → Telnet/SSH

## QNAP Infrastructure Details
