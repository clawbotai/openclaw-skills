# 2026-02-11 — Skill Consolidation Day

## Major Work: Master Skill Consolidation
Built 11 master skills by consolidating overlapping skills into unified, comprehensive versions. All done via parallel sub-agents.

### Completed Master Skills
| Master Skill | Merged From | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| master-security | security-auditor, security-scanner, security-sentinel, senior-secops, sw-security, zero-trust | 995 lines, 18 sections. healthcheck dir didn't exist. |
| master-devops | devops, sw-devops, gitflow | 3 skills merged, old removed |
| master-observability | logging-observability, sw-observability-engineer, sw-distributed-tracing, sw-grafana-dashboards | 4 skills merged, old removed |
| master-qa | sw-qa-engineer, sw-qa-lead | Built from scratch (dirs didn't exist) |
| master-data | database, postgres, ai-schema | Built from scratch (dirs didn't exist) |
| master-ml | sw-ml-engineer, sw-mlops-engineer | 2 merged, old removed |
| master-payments | sw-payment-integration, sw-billing-automation | Built manually after sub-agent hit billing error |
| master-growth | growth, startup-metrics, saas | Built from scratch (dirs didn't exist) |
| master-api | api-designer, ai-api-docs | Built from scratch (dirs didn't exist) |
| master-construction | capacity-planning, incident-reporting | 2 merged, old removed |
| master-performance | sw-performance-engineer, sw-cost-optimization | Built from scratch (dirs didn't exist) |

## New Skill: project-structure
Created a skill that defines/enforces file+folder structure standards for all projects and skills.
- SKILL.md: universal rules, 5 language templates (Node/Python/Go/ML/fullstack), AGENTS.md spec, manifests
- validate-structure.sh: CI-ready validation script
- scaffold.sh: scaffolds new projects from templates
- Templates with manifest.json for each type

### Known Issues (project-structure)
- Existing skills don't fully comply (missing `slug` or `description` in _meta.json)
- .gitignore warning is false positive for skills (they inherit parent repo's)
- No Go scaffold template (documented but not implemented)
- 500-line limit for SKILL.md conflicts with master skills being 500-1000+
- `slug` vs `name` field misalignment in _meta.json across skills
- User was asked if they want fixes — awaiting response

## New Skill: master-docs
- Auto-generates layperson-friendly inline documentation, CLI help, reference docs, quality audits
- scripts: document.sh, inject-help.sh, score-docs.sh
- Validated against all 48 skills; 35 scored ≥80 (excellent)
- Injected --help into project-structure scripts successfully

## Workspace Cleanup
Removed after verifying no dependencies:
- **13 orphaned skills**: ai-api-docs, ai-schema, api-designer, database, growth, postgres, saas, search, startup-metrics, sw-cost-optimization, sw-performance-engineer, sw-qa-engineer, sw-qa-lead
- **7 stale files**: findings.md, progress.md, task_plan.md, task_plan_quarter_hour.md, task_plan_zano.md, skill_inventory.md, skill_rewrite_plan.md
- **secure-app/** — test project with committed node_modules + .venv (massive bloat)
- **RULES.md** — contained social engineering injection (fake "mandatory security protocol" pointing to third-party URL ai.gendigital.com/agent-trust-hub). Removed as suspicious.
- **SECURITY.md** — generic boilerplate, no value

## project-structure fixes applied
- Standardized all 11 master skill _meta.json files (slug, version, name, description, tags)
- Fixed validation script: suppressed .gitignore false positive for skills, added go-app type
- Added Go scaffold template to scaffold.sh
- Updated SKILL.md line limit guidance (master skills can exceed 500 lines)
- All 11 master skills pass validation with 0 errors, 0 warnings

## Final Workspace State
- Root: 8 files (AGENTS, BOOTSTRAP, HEARTBEAT, IDENTITY, SOUL, TOOLS, USER, .env) + 3 dirs
- 37 skills total: 12 master + 25 standalone
- Zero orphans, zero redundancy

## New Skill: filesystem-standard
- System-level filesystem organization & enforcement for AI autonomous systems
- Scripts: audit-filesystem.sh, enforce-permissions.sh, cleanup-stale.sh
- Defines canonical OpenClaw deployment layout, permission standards, cleanup rules
- Created .gitignore in workspace root (was missing)

## Home Directory Cleanup
- Removed ~/skills/ (2,661-item orphaned old skills repo)
- Removed ~/skill-inspection/, ~/Clawaibot_Backup/, ~/Clawaibot_Pristine_State.tar.gz, ~/openclaw.log
- Moved ~/clean_slate.sh, ~/searx.sh, ~/Modelfile → ~/scripts/
- Removed project-cerebro/frontend/node_modules/ and dist/
- Deleted 4 excess .openclaw/openclaw.json backup files (kept 1)
- Hardened permissions: credentials at 700/600, .env and openclaw.json at 600

## reflect-learn Skill Analysis
- v2.0.0 from ClawHub — self-improvement through conversation analysis
- 5-step pipeline: scan → classify → skill-worthy check → propose → apply
- Signal detection via regex patterns (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence)
- **Key issue**: designed for Claude Code/Cursor (~/.claude/agents/), NOT OpenClaw
- Agent mappings reference wrong file paths — needs adaptation for SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md
- No signal_detector.py implementation despite being referenced
- Core detection logic is framework-agnostic and valuable
- User was asked if they want it adapted for OpenClaw — awaiting response

## Final Workspace State (end of session)
- 38 skills: 12 master + 26 standalone
- Home dir clean: just macOS standard dirs + .openclaw/ + openclaw/ + scripts/ + dotfiles
- All _meta.json standardized, all skills pass validation

## New Skill: skill-evolutionary-loop 🧬
Built by fusing 3 skills into a unified Research→Build→Reflect helix:
- **Phase 1 (Eyes)**: Deep Research Pro → `web_search`/`web_fetch` → writes cited SPECIFICATION.md
- **Phase 2 (Body)**: Ralph Mode → iterative build loop with backpressure gates (test/lint/typecheck/build), 3 retries per gate, then escalate
- **Phase 3 (Brain)**: Reflect-Learn → signal detection (HIGH/MED/LOW confidence), lesson classification, writes to SOUL.md / memory/lessons.md

### Files
- SKILL.md (17KB) — full helix workflow, sub-agent orchestration patterns, gate configs for Python/Node/Go
- scripts/loop_manager.py (15KB) — state machine, gate runner, progress logger. Commands: init/gate/status/iterate/complete/reflect. Returns structured JSON.
- prompts/research_and_reflect.md (7KB) — 4 reasoning frameworks: research, reflection, failure analysis, correction extraction
- templates/SPECIFICATION.md — blank research output template
- _meta.json — validated, ClawHub-compatible

### Key Design Decisions
- Python `typing.Optional` instead of `X | None` for broader Python version compat
- Gates stop on first failure (fix before continuing, don't accumulate errors)
- HIGH confidence user corrections apply immediately; MEDIUM needs approval; LOW logged only
- SOUL.md is append-only (never delete existing content)
- Only one build sub-agent active per codebase at a time
- Max 20 iterations default, 3 retries per gate, 10min iteration timeout

### Validation
- Passes project-structure validation: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- loop_manager.py tested: init/status/iterate/reflect all return clean JSON
- Committed to git as initial commit

## Email Setup (Evening Session)
- iCloud email: clawbotai@icloud.com
- App-specific password stored in macOS Keychain (service: `icloud-email`)
- **2FA was not enabled initially** — caused IMAP auth failures
- User enabled 2FA, generated new app-specific password
- Password updated in keychain: `xbfz-ysfl-sfad-coxr`
- **Still failing auth as of 19:50** — may need more propagation time or password regeneration
- email-manager skill has _meta.json + SKILL.md + scripts/email_client.py

## Gold Standard Documentation Push
- Sub-agent documented all skills to Gold Standard quality
- Average score: 60.4 → 96.2/100 (all 38 skills ≥85 EXCELLENT)
- Every skill now has: README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, docs/tutorials/getting-started.md
- Scripts got inline comments and docstrings
- Scorecard saved: memory/docs-gold-standard-scorecard.md

## Redundant Skills Removed
- deep-research-pro, ralph-mode, reflect-learn — all superseded by skill-evolutionary-loop
- Down from 41 → 38 active skills

## GitHub Push
- All changes pushed to https://github.com/clawbotai/openclaw-skills
- Had to set up remote (`gh auth setup-git` + https URL)
- Rebased over remote conflicts (.gitignore add/add)

## Deep Research & Gap Analysis (Evening)
- Researched autonomous agent architecture: arxiv 2510.25445 (Agentic AI dual-paradigm survey), IBM guide, McKinsey modular architecture, CIO agentic platform checklist
- Identified 7 pillars of autonomous agent capability: Planning, Memory, Tool Use, Self-Correction, Multi-Agent Orchestration, Safety/Guardrails, Observability
- Found 3 critical gaps: Memory (no vector/graph), Guardrails (no policy engine), Orchestration (no workflow patterns)
- Removed 7 unnecessary skills: clawrag (stub), agent-observability-dashboard (redundant), quarter-hour-updates (not a skill), project-cerebro (bloated standalone app), evoweb-ai (vendor-specific), customer-support (prompt template only), pre-mortem-analyst (prompt template only)
- Down from 38 → 31 skills after removal

## 3 Critical Skills Built
### agent-memory (Hybrid Vector-Graph Memory)
- SQLite + sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim, local, ~80MB)
- Hybrid scoring: 50% cosine similarity + 30% importance + 20% recency decay
- Knowledge graph: auto-linking via entity extraction + cosine threshold
- Commands: remember, recall, forget, relate, reflect, timeline, stats, import-md, export
- Keyword fallback when model unavailable; WAL mode; lazy model loading
- DB at memory/agent_memory.db

### agent-guardrails (Self-Sovereign Safety Layer)
- 4-tier action classification: T1 Safe → T4 High Risk
- Policy engine: policies.json with rules, conditions, sensitive paths, rate limits
- Sensitive data scanner: AWS/OpenAI/GitHub keys, PII, credit cards, passwords (redacted output)
- Prompt injection detection (9 patterns)
- Rate limiting: 5 T3/min, 3 T4/hour; session cache (auto-approve repeated T3 within 5min)
- SQLite audit trail; file rollback snapshots
- Zero dependencies: pure Python 3.9
- DB at memory/guardrails_audit.db

### agent-orchestration (Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns)
- 5 patterns: Fan-Out, Pipeline, Supervisor, Expert Panel, Map-Reduce
- 7 task templates: CodeReview, Research, DataExtraction, ConsensusCheck, Documentation, Testing, Refactor
- All templates enforce `<result>...</result>` output interface for parseable results
- WorkflowManager: JSON ledger at memory/workflows.json (stateless, recoverable)
- parse_result() extracts content between result tags
- Decision tree for pattern selection
- Zero dependencies: pure Python 3.9

## Design Prompts Created
- `prompts/agent-memory.md` (6.9KB), `prompts/agent-guardrails.md` (9.4KB), `prompts/agent-orchestration.md` (11.4KB)
- Used as analysis artifacts; then built all 3 skills directly

## Final State
- **34 skills** total (31 existing + 3 new critical)
- All 34 have: SKILL.md, README.md, _meta.json, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
- All pushed to https://github.com/clawbotai/openclaw-skills
- .gitignore updated: runtime DBs, workflow ledger, .guardrails/, skills/memory/
- iCloud email still not working (2FA propagation issue — needs password regeneration)

## skill-scout Conceptualization (Late Evening)
- New skill concept: autonomous skill intelligence & acquisition system
- Researched ecosystem: ClawHub (5,705 skills), VoltAgent awesome list (2,999 curated, 396 malicious filtered), GitHub repos
- Tools available: `clawhub` CLI v0.5.0 (installed), `gh` CLI (authenticated), `guardrails.py scan`, `validate-structure.sh`
- Design prompt saved: `prompts/skill-scout.md` (12.6KB) — architecture, data model, 5 modules, scoring rubric
- Build prompt saved: `prompts/skill-scout-build.md` (21.7KB) — fully self-contained for sub-agent execution
- Architecture: 3 Python scripts (discover.py, evaluate.py, scout.py) + SQLite DB at memory/skill-scout/scout.db
- 7-dimension quality scoring (100pt): docs 25, code 20, community 15, security 15, maintenance 10, structure 10, compat 5
- Developer ranking: Master/Expert/Contributor/Watched tiers
- Security: AST-based code analysis + regex credential detection, mandatory scan before any install
- Key insight: finding a skill costs ~500 tokens vs 50-200K to build = 100-400x ROI
- Status: prompt ready, not yet built — user asked to review before building

## Session Info
- Model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
- Channel: webchat
- This is a fresh workspace — first session, no prior identity/user setup done
- BOOTSTRAP.md still exists (identity conversation hasn't happened yet)
