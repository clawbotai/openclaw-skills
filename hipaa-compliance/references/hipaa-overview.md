# HIPAA Overview

## Core Rules
- **Privacy Rule**: Limits uses/disclosures of Protected Health Information (PHI); grants patient rights (access, amendment, accounting of disclosures).
- **Security Rule**: Requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for electronic PHI (ePHI). Built on risk management rather than prescriptive checklists.
- **Breach Notification Rule**: Mandates notification timelines (≤60 days) to affected individuals, HHS OCR, and sometimes media when unsecured PHI is compromised.
- **HITECH / Omnibus updates**: Extend liability to business associates, require BAAs, emphasize encryption, and increase penalties.

## Terminology
- **PHI**: Individually identifiable health information in any form.
- **ePHI**: PHI that is created, stored, transmitted electronically.
- **Covered Entity (CE)**: Health plans, providers, clearinghouses.
- **Business Associate (BA)**: Any vendor handling PHI on behalf of a CE.
- **BAA**: Contract defining permitted uses, safeguards, incident duties.

## Required Documentation
1. Risk analysis + risk management plan.
2. Policies: access control, incident response, data retention, media disposal.
3. Workforce training records.
4. Vendor inventory + BAAs.
5. Audit logs and monitoring evidence.
6. Contingency plan (backup, DR, emergency mode).

## Common Failure Modes
- No documented risk analysis or annual review.
- Overly broad PHI access or orphaned accounts.
- Lack of encryption for data at rest or in transit.
- Missing audit logs or alerts for ePHI access.
- Storage of PHI in non-compliant third-party tools (email, shared drives) without BAAs.
- Delayed breach notification due to undefined escalation paths.
