Business Summary: Pension Optimization Engine
1. Executive Overview
The Pension Optimization Engine is a specialized fintech solution designed for the Colombian market. It transitions pension planning from a passive "wait and see" approach to an active, strategic investment model.


Unlike standard calculators that merely estimate future payouts based on current trends, this engine reverse-engineers the specific financial contributions required to achieve a user's target pension (e.g., "$10 Million COP/month"). It identifies the most efficient path to wealth, potentially saving users millions in unnecessary contributions while maximizing their legal pension returns under Ley 797 de 2003.


2. The Problem
Complexity & Obscurity: The Colombian pension system (RPM - Colpensiones) involves complex actuarial math (IBL, replacement rates, inflation indexing, weeks caps) that is opaque to the average worker.
Data Fragmentation: User data is trapped in messy PDF/Excel history files from Colpensiones, full of format inconsistencies and date overlaps.
Passive Acceptance: Users blindly contribute what they are told, often discovering too late that they have over-contributed for diminished returns or under-contributed and missed their target.
3. The Solution
A web-based "Official Validator" and Optimization Platform that:


Ingests & Cleans Data: Automatically extracts and standardizes labor history from raw Colpensiones PDFs and Excel files.
Validates Status: Instantly verifies weeks quoted, current IBL, and transition regime status.
Simulates Scenarios: Runs thousands of simulations to find the "Efficient Frontier"—the sweet spot between contribution cost and pension payout.
4. Key Features & Technology
A. Automated "Truth" Layer
Universal Parser: Proprietary algorithms (


extract_semanas.py
, 


process_both.py
) that read unstructured Colpensiones histories with high precision.
Hidden DOM Calculation: Uses a "Hidden DOM" strategy in the web app to run complex logic securely on the client side before syncing with the backend.
B. Strategic Tools (The "Premium" Suite)
Goal Seeker (Reverse Calculator): The user inputs a target (e.g., "I want a $5M pension"). The system calculates exactly how much they need to contribute monthly to hit that target with minimum waste.
History Booster: Analyzes past gaps. It calculates the ROI of retroactively paying for missing weeks vs. increasing future contributions. Case studies show this can reduce total investment cost by ~45%.
Full Burden Calculator: Projects not just the pension contribution (16%) but the total cost of ownership (Health + ARL), giving freelancers an accurate monthly budget.
