Pension Optimization Engine: Technical & Strategic Summary
1. Executive Summary
We have developed a valid MVP for a "Pension Optimization Engine" tailored for the Colombian market (Colpensiones - RPM). Unlike existing market tools that function as passive simulators ("What will I get?"), this engine performs Strategic Reverse-Engineering ("What must I pay to get $10M?").


By combining historical data extraction, actuarial gap analysis, and "history boosting" simulations, we demonstrated how a user ('Piedad') could reduce their required monthly investment by ~45% (saving ~$3.8 Million/month) to achieve the same high-pension target.
2. Core Methodologies Developed
A. Automated Data Ingestion (The "Truth" Layer)
* Problem: Manual data entry is error-prone. PDF and Excel histories from Colpensiones are complex and messy (overlaps, varying formats).
* Solution: Built robust extractors (extract_semanas.py, process_both.py) that parse raw PDF/Excel files, resolve date overlaps, and standardize the "Labor History" into a clean, computable dataset.
* Value: Instant, accurate baseline establishment.
B. Strategic Reverse-Engineering (The "Solver" Layer)
* Problem: Users want a specific lifestyle (e.g., "$10 Million/month pension") but don't know the path to get there.
* Solution: Created a solver algorithm (solve_pension_gap.py) that:
   1. Takes the desired target (e.g., $10M).
   2. Simulates future contributions for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10-year horizons.
   3. Binary-searches the exact "Ingreso Base de Cotización" (IBC) needed to hit that target.
   4. Respects legal constraints (SMMLV caps, 80% maximum replacement rate).
* Value: Actionable, specific financial roadmap instead of vague estimates.
C. Historical "Boosting" Simulation (The "ROI" Layer)
* Problem: Users often ignore the impact of past gaps or low contributions on their final average.
* Solution: Built a simulator (boost_history.py) that asks: "What if we retroactively increased contributions for the last X years?" (e.g., +$5M/mo for 8 years).
* Result (Case Study - Piedad):
   * Scenario A (Status Quo): Required nearly ~$8.4M/month for 3 years to reach the target.
   * Scenario B (Boosted History): Required only ~$4.5M/month for 3 years to reach the same target.
   * ROI: The cost of fixing the past was vastly outweighed by the massive reduction in future monthly burden.
D. Full Burden Costing (The "Real World" Layer)
* Problem: Most simulators only show the "Pension Contribution" (16%), hiding the true cost to the user.
* Solution: Integrated a full burden calculator (calculate_full_burden.py) that includes Health (12.5%) and ARL (0.522%), providing the user with the "True Check Amount" they must write every month.
3. Case Study Results (Piedad)
Target: $10,000,000 COP Pension.

	5. Conclusion
We have moved beyond simple "calculator" functionality into Actuarial Wealth Planning. By dynamically simulating the interaction between Historical Corrections (Boosts) and Future Contributions, the engine identifies the "Efficient Frontier"—the specific strategy that yields the maximum legal pension for the minimum total investment.
