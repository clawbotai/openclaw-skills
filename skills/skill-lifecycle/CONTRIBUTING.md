# Contributing to skill-lifecycle

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This skill merges the evolutionary loop and runtime monitoring subsystems — changes should consider both.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the skill:
   ```bash
   cd skills/skill-lifecycle
   ```
2. Review `SKILL.md` for the full skill specification
3. Familiarize yourself with the `scripts/` and `templates/` directories

## Making Changes

- Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`
- Follow existing code conventions and comment style
- Test changes against at least one skill target
- Update documentation if behavior changes

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`
2. Describe what changed and why in the PR description
3. Ensure all existing tests and validations pass
4. Request review from a maintainer
5. Squash and merge once approved

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and expected vs actual behavior.
